# Adventure Quest - CLI RPG Game

## Overview
"Adventure Quest" is a text-based role-playing game (RPG) built in C++. Players explore a fantasy world filled with heroes, monsters, and non-playable characters (NPCs), engage in turn-based combat, complete quests, and level up. The game uses object-oriented programming (OOP) principles such as abstract classes, dynamic polymorphism, interfaces, and RTTI to create a modular and extensible game structure.

## Features
- **Character Classes**: Hero, Monster, and NPC with various subtypes and unique attributes.
- **Combat System**: Turn-based combat with actions like attack, use abilities, defend, and use items.
- **Quests and Exploration**: Interact with NPCs, accept quests, and explore different environments.
- **Inventory System**: Manage items like health potions, weapons, and special artifacts.
- **Progression**: Gain experience points (XP), level up, and improve stats.
- **RTTI Support**: Run-time type identification to apply character-specific effects (e.g., different combat mechanics for different character types).
- **Memory Management**: Use manual memory management with raw pointers, ensuring proper cleanup and avoiding memory leaks.

## Requirements
- C++11 or later
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
